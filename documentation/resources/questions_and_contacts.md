### Questions

To Arcenis Rojas: 
1. You note in your [introduction to cepumd](https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/posts/20240124-cepumd-intro/cepumd-intro.html#dealing-with-inconsistent-code-definitions) that calculating medians (and I'm assuming any quantile value) with `ce_quantiles()` is not recommended for integrated expenditures because the calculation involves using weights from both the Diary and Survey instruments. Can you explain that a bit further?

2. Is there any way to account for CUs that did _not_ purchase an item in the specified purchasing period and calculate means/percentiles for only CUs that did?

3. What is the way I can tell if a UCC/item is only from the interview or diary product?
